# Event Description "Crazy Joe"
Crazy Joe is an alliance-based player vs. system event that can be activated twice during the event period, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. During this event, players must defend against waves of bandits sent by Joe, with the rewards improving based on the number of successfully defended waves.

**All alliance members are attacked.**

**After the event:**
Castles will be burning, and you will find a report of attacks on your castle - stay calm, it's part of the event. You can use crystals to extinguish the barricade.

## Rules and Procedure
### Attack Waves:

The event consists of 20 attack waves.

* Waves 7, 14, and 17 attack only players who are online.
* Waves 10 and 20 attack the alliance headquarters (Tundra HQ and Icefield HQ).
* The remaining waves attack all alliance members.

### Points and Rewards:
1. Points are earned by eliminating Joe's units, with the amount of points depending on the percentage of defeated units.
2. Participants do not lose resources in case of defeat, and protective shields do not work during the event.
3. If a player fails to defend twice, they will no longer be attacked, but can still earn points by supporting allies.

### Strategy
1. Defense and Support:
   * Before the event starts, coordinate with other alliance members to decide who will send troops to whom and who will provide support to you. Plan ahead; the last 5 minutes before the event may not be enough.
   * If you don't want to exchange troops, gather all your troops in the castle and send back any support from other allies.
   * Before sending your troops to other castles, place three defensive heroes on the barricade of your castle.
   * Remember the rule - if you are supporting allies, send all your troops to other castles. If you keep troops in your castle, send back any support.
   * After two defeats, support other allies who are still in the game.
2. Healing Troops:
   * If all your troops are in the castle, you can heal them after each round.
   * If all your troops are in allied castles, you can heal them in rounds 10 and 20 because if you send troops to other castles, you cannot have your army in your castle, reducing the points your supporting allies can earn.
3. Optimal Use of Heroes:
   * The best heroes for defense are those with defensive skills, e.g., Sergey.
   * Send troops to other alliance members to earn points both for defending your base and for supporting others.
   * Send your best troops to defend allied bases to maximize points.

### Tactical Examples
1. Phase 1 (Waves 1-10):
   * Send troops between bases to evenly distribute defense.
   * Protect HQ during waves 10 and 20 as a priority.
2. Phase 2 (Waves 11-20):
   * After HQ waves, recover your troops and send full marches back to allied bases.
   * Continue defense and support according to the rules of phase 1.

By following these strategies, you can effectively defend against Joe's attack waves and achieve high scores, which translates into better rewards.
