# Event Description "Crazy Joe"
Crazy Joe is an alliance-based player vs. system event that can be activated twice during the event period, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. During this event, players must defend against waves of bandits sent by Joe, with the rewards improving based on the number of successfully defended waves.

**All alliance members are attacked.**

**After the event:**
Castles will be burning, and you will find a report of attacks on your castle - stay calm, it's part of the event. 
You can use crystals to extinguish the barricade or wait for 30 min and the fire will stop by itself.

## Rules and Procedure
### Attack Waves:

The event consists of 20 attack waves.

* Waves 7, 14, and 17 attack only **players who are online**.
* Waves 10 and 20 attack the **alliance headquarter** (Tundra HQ).
* The remaining waves attack **all alliance members**.

### Points and Rewards:
1. Points are earned by eliminating Joe's units, with the amount of points depending on the percentage of defeated units.
2. Participants do not lose resources in case of defeat, and protective shields do not work during the event.
3. If a city fails to defend twice, it will no longer be attacked, but the player can still earn points by supporting allies.

### Strategy

There are two main strategies in Crazy Joe. 
1. **All own troops out, reinforcements in** - Get all of your troops from your city and send them to reinforce others
2. **All own troops in, no reinforcements in** - Keep all of your troops in your city and do not get any reinforcements

There is no mixed strategy, as if you keep some troops in your city and keep reinforcements, none of you will score high

1. Defense and Support:
   * Before the event starts (I recommend 30 minutes before), coordinate with other alliance members to decide who will send troops to whom. Plan ahead; it takes time to agree and send out all troops.
   * If you don't want to exchange troops, gather all your troops in the castle and send back any reinforcements from other allies. You might keep the lowest level troops out farming, as they won't bring you much scores anyway
   * Before sending your troops to other castles, place one defensive hero (Sergey or Bahiti) and two strongest heroes on the barricade.
   * Remember the rule - **if you reinforce allies, send all your troops from your castle. If you keep your troops in your castle, send back any reinforcements**.
   * If a city fallen once - you might want to send them more reinforcements, so they stay longer in the game
   * If a city fallen two times - call back reinforcements and send them to support other allies who are still in the game.
2. Healing Troops:
   * If all your troops are in the castle, you can heal troops after each round.
   * If all your troops are in the other castles, don't heal your troops, **you can only heal them in rounds 10 and 20**. If you do heal them in between rounds - they will get stuck in your city and that will break the strategy "all own troops out, reinforcements in", which again, will reduce points you and your supporting allies can earn.
3. Optimal Use of Heroes:
   * The best heroes for defense are those with defensive skills, e.g. Sergey, Patric.
   * Send troops to other alliance members to earn points both for defending your base and for supporting others.
   * Send your best troops to defend allied bases to maximize points, if you still have the lowest level troops, you may consider sending them out to farm or banner

### Tactical Examples
1. Phase 1 (Waves 1-10):
   * Send troops between bases to evenly distribute defense.
   * Protect HQ during waves 10 and 20 as a priority.
2. Phase 2 (Waves 11-20):
   * After HQ wave, recover your troops and send full marches back to allied bases.
   * Continue defense and support according to the rules of phase 1.

By following these strategies, you can effectively defend against Joe's attack waves and achieve high scores, which translates into better rewards.
