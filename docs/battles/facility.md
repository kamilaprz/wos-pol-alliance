# Facilities Guide

Facilities are buildings that provide various bonuses to the alliance, making it crucial to occupy them. All alliance members benefit from these bonuses, so it's important to secure these facilities as quickly as possible. Additionally, everyone receives a first control reward.

## Currently, there are six facilities in the POL alliance:

* Level 1 Tech Facility: Research speed increased by 5%
* Level 2 Weapons Facility: Troop attack increased by 5%
* Level 3 Construction Facility: Building speed increased by 8%
* Level 1 Production Facility: Resource production speed increased by 5%
* Level 2 Defense Facility: Troop defense increased by 5%
* Level 2 Training Facility: Troop training speed increased by 5%
* Level 3 Expedition Facility: Troop march speed increased by 15%

We might also be able to fight for:

* Level 4 Defense Facility: Troop defense increased by 8%

## Strategy

When attempting to occupy a new facility, it's important to assess how many other alliances might try to take it over. An alliance must have their banners leading up to the facility to be eligible to occupy it.

### Taking Over a Facility for the First Time:
**Quick Occupation:**
Get into the facility as quickly as possible. Often, some members will teleport closer and launch a solo attack as soon as the facility can be occupied.

**Reinforcement:**
Once one member is inside, send troops to reinforce the facility and wait for the 30-minute timer to pass. After that, the facility will remain under our control for three days.

### Defending the Facility:
After three days, the facility becomes vulnerable for 24 hours and can be taken over by other alliance. We need to be ready to defend it to keep it within our alliance.

Solo Attacker Strategy: If there is a solo attacker trying to take over the facility, we often withdraw our troops to let them take it over. Then, we attack the facility to reclaim it for POL. This tactic resets the timer, making us wait only 30 minutes instead of 24 hours to regain control.


By following this strategy, we can maximize our control over facilities and the bonuses they provide to our alliance.
