# What is it about?

Fortress is a special building controlled by mercenaries. 
There are 12 fortresses and 4 strongholds in the state. 
Each building requires specific power to defeat them, for fortress it is 4,808,776 combat power, for stronghold 19,678,800.
Basically fortress and stronghold battles are similar, but the stronghold is stronger and has better rewards.

## Strategy

The goal of this event is to occupy given building. If any alliance can defend fortress for 30 min, they win it. 
If none occupied the fortress for 30 min, it is the last alliance in the fortress/stronghold that wins.

To join a fight you should use advanced teleport and move close to the fortress. 
There is a countdown below the fortress and it is recommended to teleport 10min before the events.

If you have enough combat power you can consider doing attack solo for fortress, but a rally is recommended as all the participants will take some awards.
If you see a lot of enemies coming, you can also consider going solo to save time and take it over as first person. 

## Healing troops
During the event heal your troops in batches of 15-20min or use healing speedup. 
Send troops continuously to the fortress, to refill garrison. If your hero is still in the fortress, send healed troops without any hero. 
If none of your heroes is in the fortress, send all your troops with a hero which has good defence skill.
